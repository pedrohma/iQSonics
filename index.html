      <p> We at iQsonics are developing Sing and Speak 4 Kids, an online music-based language program to support young children with delayed speech development. This interactive program, using a clinically tested therapy called  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Developmental-Speech-Language-Training-Children-Disorders/dp/1849058490/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="_blank" class="reference">Developmental Speech Language Training through Music (DSLM)*</a>, serves as a supplement to other speech therapy modalities and will be guided by the Training Team of teachers, therapists and families. </p>

      <p>The child who will benefit would have some emerging vocalization skills, but is slower than normal in developing their verbal communication skills. Some kids with Autism Spectrum Disorder have shown significant speech development with DSLM. If they have ever sung a song or hummed a tune, this indicates an excellent chance that they could benefit.</p>
      <p><b>Sing and Speak 4 Kids</b> consists of an on-screen singer teaching the child a fun song with a story relating to their developing lives and target vocabulary words with corresponding images. The musical elements gradually “fade” into normal speech patterns. The program is designed to help the child learn to speak those words in the appropriate context and have increased engagement with their family and community. </p>
